For the VOTR-SSD model, you can calculate the number of parameters in each layer by following this general formula:

For Convolutional Layers:

'''py
number_of_parameters = (kernel_height * kernel_width * input_channels + 1 (for bias)) * output_channels
'''

For Fully Connected Layers:
'''py
number_of_parameters = (input_units + 1 (for bias)) * output_units
'''
Now, let's break down the process for VOTR-SSD:

Count the number of parameters in each layer of the VOTR backbone. You can find the architecture details in the paper or the code. Make sure to consider all the convolutional layers, including those in the backbone and the head.

Count the number of parameters in the VOTR head. This includes the convolutional layers used for feature extraction, as well as any additional layers introduced for the voxel density information (if you've implemented the changes discussed earlier).

Count the number of parameters in the SSD part of the VOTR-SSD model. This includes the parameters for the default bounding box generation and the classification layers.

Finally, sum the number of parameters from each layer to get the total number of parameters in the VOTR-SSD model.

Keep in mind that the actual number of parameters in your modified VOTR-SSD model may differ from the original VOTR-SSD model, depending on the changes you made to incorporate voxel density information.

If you want to calculate the number of parameters for the VOTR-SSD model in PyTorch, you can use the following code snippet:

'''py
def count_parameters(model):
    return sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters() if p.requires_grad)

votr_ssd_model = ... # Load or create your VOTR-SSD model
total_params = count_parameters(votr_ssd_model)
print(f'Total number of parameters: {total_params}')
'''
